# Flask QR Code Generator

This Flask application provides a simple web service for generating QR codes from URLs.
Users can make a GET request to the `/qr` endpoint with a `url` parameter, and the server
will respond with a downloadable QR code image in PNG format.

## Setup

1. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install Flask qrcode[pil]
   ```

2. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python your_app_file.py
   ```

   Replace `your_app_file.py` with the name of your Python script containing the Flask application.

3. Access the QR code generator in your web browser:

   ```plaintext
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/qr?url=your_url_here
   ```

   Replace `your_url_here` with the URL you want to encode into the QR code.

## How it Works

- The application uses the Flask web framework to handle HTTP requests.

- The QR code is generated using the `qrcode` library.

- The generated QR code image is returned as a downloadable PNG file.

## API Endpoint

### `/qr` (HTTP GET)

- **Parameters:**
  - `url` (required): The URL to be encoded into the QR code.

- **Example Request:**

  ```plaintext
  GET http://127.0.0.1:5000/qr?url=https://example.com
  ```

- **Example Response:**

  The server responds with a downloadable PNG image containing the QR code for the specified URL.

## Dependencies
